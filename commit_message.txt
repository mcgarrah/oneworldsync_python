Add nutritional data integration support

This commit adds support for extracting nutritional information from food/beverage products in the 1WorldSync Content1 API. Key changes include:

- Added examples for nutritional data extraction and integration with Django
- Created documentation for nutritional data structure and nutrient code mapping
- Identified the correct path to nutritional information in the API response
- Provided a list of known food product GTINs with reliable nutritional information
- Updated README and documentation with key findings
- Added test scripts for both standalone and Django-dependent usage
- Updated CHANGELOG.md for v0.2.5 release

The nutritional information is found in `item -> nutrientInformation -> nutrientDetail` rather than in `tradeItemInformation` as initially expected.

- simple_nutrition_example.py: Standalone example for nutritional data extraction
